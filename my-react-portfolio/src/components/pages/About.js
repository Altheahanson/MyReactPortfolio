      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I am a Software Developer based in Toronto Canada and I specialize in building 
      Javascript based websites and applications. I help convert a vision and an idea
       into meaningful and useful products. Having a sharp eye for product evolution 
       helps me prioritize tasks, iterate fast and deliver faster. Currently, 
       I'm enrolled in a Full-Time Coding Bootcamp at the University of Toronto. 
       My expected Completion date is August 3rd, 2022.
